                <p class="copy">Out of the voting-eligible population in Texas, 46.3 percent voted in 2018. Nationwide, turnout was 50.1 percent.

                <p class="copy">“Texas simply has not had particularly competitive elections, and the change in competition made a difference this year,” said Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida who runs the United States Elections Project.
                </p>
                <p class="copy">This year, “campaigns had a reason to be engaged, and money flowed to the competitive races, which funded ads and in turn mobilized voters. Everything feeds on itself when there’s a competitive election,” McDonald said.
                </p>
                <p class="copy">To calculate turnout, McDonald divides the total number of ballots counted in a state by that state’s voting-eligible population instead of using more common metrics such as the voting-age population or number of registered voters. McDonald calculates the voting-eligible population by taking the voting-age population — everyone who is 18 or older — and adjusting for noncitizens and felons ineligible to vote in that state.
                </p>
                <p class="copy">“The voting-eligible population makes it easier to make comparisons across states and across time because the way states manage registered voters differs quite a bit,” McDonald said.
                </p>
                <p class="copy">Low turnout has historically plagued Texas in part because of uncompetitive races at the top of the ballot. In 2014, when Republicans John Cornyn and Greg Abbott won their respective races for U.S. Senate and governor by over 20 points, just 28.3 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, among the worst in the nation.
                </p>
                <p class="copy">In 2018, Democrats fielded candidates in every Texas congressional district for the first time in well over a decade. They were boosted statewide by U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s spirited bid to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz. O’Rourke — whose bid garnered national attention — fell short by less than 3 percentage points. Yet Democrats flipped Republican-held seats in the U.S. House, the Texas Legislature as well as lower on the ballot.
